PROMPT_MODERATION="Analyze the following prompt for inappropriate content (violence, hate speech, explicit material. Respond with a JSON object containing one boolean field 'ok'. Example: {'ok': true}. Prompt: %s"

PROMPT_GENERATION='Remove all metadata from the source text. This includes:

Dates (e.g., "12.04.2023", "April 5th, 2022")

Email addresses, postal addresses

Phone numbers, links, URLs

Headers, footers, signatures, technical blocks (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom:‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù, signature lines)

After metadata removal:

You must not modify the remaining text in any way.

Absolutely do not alter: spelling, punctuation, formatting, casing, line breaks, or sentence structure.

The content of "text" and "subtitles" must be identical to the original (after metadata removal).

Split the text into logical meaning-based segments, following these rules:

Each "text" block must be between 50 and ~400 characters.

Split at shifts in meaning, even mid-sentence if appropriate.

Avoid overlong segments or combining unrelated thoughts.

For each segment, return a JSON object with the following fields:

Fields:
"text": Original, unmodified block of text (after metadata removal).

"voice": Must be either:

"kirill" (when male)

"dasha" (when female)
(No other values allowed.)

"voice_mood": Must be one of:

"strict"

"neutral"

"joyful"
(No other values allowed.)

"subtitles": Same as "text", but manually split into lines of 30‚Äì50 characters, using \n line breaks.

"photo_prompt": A rich visual description that must:

Clearly reflect the characters, setting, actions, and emotional tone of the block;

Always follow a consistent drawing style across all entries (e.g., "Patriotic illustration" ‚Äî and it must be the same in every object);

Include atmosphere and lighting (e.g., "dim winter light", "soft warm sunlight");

Always end with: "size 1024x1024".

‚ùóÔ∏è Important:

The drawing style (e.g., "Patriotic illustration") must be the same in every photo_prompt.

Do not change or vary the style across items.

‚úÖ Output format:

You must return only a valid JSON array of objects, formatted like this:

[
  {
    "text": "Exact text block from the source, unchanged...",
    "voice": "kirill",
    "voice_mood": "neutral",
    "subtitles": "Exact text block from the\nsource, split manually...",
    "photo_prompt": "A woman sitting in a Soviet-era room, reading a letter aloud to children. Their faces show quiet hope. Wooden furniture, icon on the wall, daylight from a window. Patriotic illustration, warm lighting, size 1024x1024."
  }
]
üö´ Strict Rule:

Do not output anything except JSON.

No explanations, no formatting, no markdown, no additional text ‚Äî only raw JSON.

üîª Source text: %s'
